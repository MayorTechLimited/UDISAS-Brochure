    <div class="flex flex-col md:flex-row gap-8 my-8">
        <div class="text-udblue font-semibold text-2xl">Between 2010 and 2024, my work as a Needs Assessor supported over 4,500 individuals in identifying and overcoming disability-related barriers affecting their studies and professional lives.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="">
        <p class="my-4 text-xl text-gray-600">The UDISAS platform is the culmination of the knowledge and experience gained during that time. It delivers an assessment service that is more comprehensive, consistent, and scalable than any single individual could offer.</p>

        <p class="my-4 text-xl text-gray-600">UDISAS puts the end user firmly in control, replacing the prescriptive, copy-and-paste outcomes of traditional assessments and empowering individuals to choose the support that best meets their needs.</p>

        <p class="text-xl text-udblue">Best wishes,</p>
